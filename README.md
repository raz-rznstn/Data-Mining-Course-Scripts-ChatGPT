## Description  
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts implementing core data mining algorithms, developed with the assistance of **ChatGPT-4o**.

The scripts are tailored to support coursework in **20595 – Data Mining course at the Open University**.

### Included Algorithms  
- **Apriori** – Mining frequent itemsets and association rules  
- **ID3** (Entropy-based) – Decision tree learning  
- **K‑Means** – Clustering with both **Euclidean** and **Manhattan** distance metrics

designed for both educational exploration and academic tasks.
